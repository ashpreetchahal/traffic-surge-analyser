# Traffic Log Analysis for Bright Networks

## Overview

This project analyses web server logs to identify unusual traffic patterns that may indicate bot activity or potential security issues. The analysis produces a detailed report highlighting IP addresses generating unusually high traffic and the types of requests they make.

I developed this solution using Python to process the provided log files and automatically generate a comprehensive report. The report helps the company understand the traffic surge and provides recommendations to handle the increased load cost-effectively.

## Files

- `log_analyser.py` — The main Python script to parse logs and generate the report.
- `sample-log.log` — Example log file used for testing (not included in submission).
- `anomaly_report.txt` — Output report generated by the script (created after running).

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure your log file (`sample-log.log`) is in the same directory as `log_analyser.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in this directory.
4. Run the script with:
   ```bash
   python3 log_analyser.py
5. After running, the script will generate a report file named anomaly_report.txt in the same folder.
6. Open anomaly_report.txt to review the findings and analysis.
